## About Password Generator:
Passwords are a real security threat. Over 80% of hacking-related breaches are due to weak or stolen passwords, a recent report shows. So if you are inspired to safeguard personal info and assets, creating secure passwords this is a great project to take live. And thatâ€™s where the Password Generator can help. Impossible-to-crack passwords are complex with multiple types of characters (numbers, letters, and symbols). Making the passwords different for each website or app also helps defend against hacking.
